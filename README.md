Our goal is to reduce food waste by redistributing surplus resources and providing essential items to those in need, fostering a more sustainable and equitable community.



## About the Project ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Welcome to **Wall of Humanity**! Our platform is designed to tackle two major issues: food and poverty. We believe in the power of community and sustainability, so we've created a space where people can donate items they no longer need, like clothes and food, to help those who truly need them. By connecting donors, social workers, and NGOs, we ensure that these items find their way to the people who need them most. People can join us as the volunteer to help us.

### Our Mission
At **Wall of Humanity**, our mission is simple: reduce waste and empower communities. We‚Äôre here to help break the cycle of poverty by redistributing surplus resources to those in need, especially in rural areas. Together, we can build a more sustainable and compassionate world. Our project reduces the wastage of and resources.

## What We Do üìù

### How Donations Work
- **Donors**: If you have clothes, food, or other essentials that you no longer need, you simply can sign up and list them on our platform to donate. We‚Äôll take care of the rest!
- **Collection & Distribution**: Once donations are made, our team works to collect and distribute these items to people or the NGO who can reach to needy people.

### Sustainability at the Core
We‚Äôre all about reducing waste and giving items a second life. By reusing goods, we not only help those in need but also contribute to a more sustainable future.

### Impact on Communities üåç
Our project isn‚Äôt just about giving away things ‚Äî it‚Äôs about changing lives. By providing basic necessities food and clothes to rural communities, we help people focus on what really matters: education, healthcare, and long-term empowerment. If someone orders food instead of buying it from outside they can invest their money in education.

## Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è 

We‚Äôve built this platform using modern tools to make it easy to use and maintain:

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (we‚Äôre using these technologies to build a fast and responsive system).
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **Google Tools**:
  - **Google Maps API**: For displaying locations of donors and recipients, calculating distances, and providing geolocation services.
  - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: For hosting the application, using cloud functions, and securely storing data. Services like **Firebase** (for authentication and real-time databases), **Google Cloud Storage** (for file storage), and **Google Cloud Functions** (for serverless computing) are utilized.
  - **Google Places API**: To help users find nearby places, like donation centers or food distribution points.
  - **Google Analytics**: For tracking user behavior and optimizing platform performance.

## The Solution  üí° 

The **Wall of Humanity** solves the problem of food and clothing waste by creating a space where people can donate their surplus items. With the help of NGOs and volunteers, we ensure that these donations are collected and distributed to those who need them the most. It‚Äôs all about making sure that no good resource goes to waste, and that everyone has access to what they need to thrive.

## Who‚Äôs It For?
